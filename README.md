## Full description of each task
###### All the comments are in russian, as the course is taight in russian.
1. __Collecting Data__ 
    The aim of the task is to collect more than 200 documents (totally volumed of more than 10000 words) using Python from diferent sources, for example, vk.com groups, wikipedia, etc. I decided to use wikipedia API as it was my first experience of using it. 
    The files of this task are:
    * [task1.py](https://github.com/alexanderlakiza/cs224/blob/main/task1.py)
    In the file you can check comments in order to understand what I did step by step.
    
2. __Regular Expressions__ 
    The aim of this task is to get familiar with Python regular expressions. The task is divided into 2 parts. The first part includes 10 mini tasks in order to get used to the syntax of regular expressions. The second part includes the process of cleaning the data collected in the 1st task.
    The files of this task are:
    * [task2.ipynb](https://github.com/alexanderlakiza/cs224/blob/main/task2.ipynb)
    In the file you can check comments in order to understand what I did step by step.
     
3. __Levenshtein Distance__ 
    The aim of this task is to get familiar with Levenshtein Distance. The task is to write a function that will show ids of documents where the word entered by user appears. A function must have exceptions in case of misspellings or absence of entered word. In order to check how the function works you need to run task3_ui.py and follow instructions.
    The files of this task are:
    * [task3.py](https://github.com/alexanderlakiza/cs224/blob/main/task3.py) 
    * [task3_ui.py](https://github.com/alexanderlakiza/cs224/blob/main/task3_ui.py)

4. __POS Tagging__ 
    The aim of this task is to tag parts of speech in the corpus, then find unusual documents where a ratio of any part of speech differs by a value greater than two standard deviations. Unusual documents are introduced in task4_stat.ipynb.
    The files of this task are:
    * [task4.py](https://github.com/alexanderlakiza/cs224/blob/main/task4.py)
    * [task4_stat.ipynb](https://github.com/alexanderlakiza/cs224/blob/main/task4_stat.ipynb)
